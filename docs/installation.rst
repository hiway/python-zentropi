============
Installation
============

If you already have virtual-environment and python-dev set up:

Quick
-----
1. Stable
    ::

        $ python3 -m venv zen
        $ source zen/bin/activate
        $ pip install zentropi


2. Current
    ::

        $ python3 -m venv zen
        $ source zen/bin/activate
        $ git clone https://github.com/zentropi/python-zentropi.git
        $ cd python-zentropi
        $ pip install -e .



Linux
-----

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04

We will need to set up Ubuntu for Python development before we can
install and use Zentropi, follow the steps below to update your
system with necessary packages:

1. Confirm that Python 3.5 or above is available
    ::

        $ sudo apt update
        $ sudo apt install python3
        $ python3 -V


    Above command should output text similar to ``Python 3.5.X``;
    at the time of writing, it was ``Python 3.5.2``.

    If the command fails, run ``sudo apt install python3``.

2. Install external requirements
    We will first set up the tools to compile and install Python libraries
    that are needed by Zentropi.

    ::

        $ sudo apt install gcc libssl-dev python3-dev python3-setuptools python3-venv


3. Install and create venv
    ::

        $ python3 -m venv zen


    This creates a python virtual-environment, which keeps your installed
    libraries separate from rest of the system.

4. Activate the venv
    ::

        $ source zen/bin/activate


    You will need to `activate` the zen virtual-environment before working
    with zentropi. A shortcut would be to add an alias to your ``~/.profile``
    or ``~/.bash_profile``:

    ::

        alias zen="source /path/to/zen/bin/activate"


    You can run ``source ~/.profile`` or open a new terminal window
    and type ``zen`` to activate the virtual-environment.

5. Install zentropi
    Stable:
    ::

        $ pip install zentropi


    Current:
    ::

        $ git clone https://github.com/zentropi/python-zentropi.git
        $ cd python-zentropi
        $ pip install -e .



MacOS
-----

Tested on MacOS Sierra.

If you are starting from scratch for python, we will also set up brew package manager.
Visit https://brew.sh/ for instructions. Once you have brew set up (and it may take
a long while, depending on your network - if you have never developed software on your
Mac before, getting all the tools is a considerable download, 2-5 GB of data.

You will not need to download as much again until the tools are updated, which is not
too often for the big packages.

More hints: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/#install3-osx

1. Update package manager
    ::

        $ brew update

2. Install python
    ::

        $ brew install python3


3. Install and create venv
    ::

        $ python3 -m venv zen


    This creates a python virtual-environment, which keeps your installed
    libraries separate from rest of the system.

4. Activate the venv
    ::

        $ source zen/bin/activate


    You will need to `activate` the zen virtual-environment before working
    with zentropi. A shortcut would be to add an alias to your ``~/.profile``
    or ``~/.bash_profile``:
    ::

        alias zen="source /path/to/zen/bin/activate"


    You can run ``source ~/.profile`` or open a new terminal window
    and type ``zen`` to activate the virtual-environment.

5. Install zentropi
    Stable:
    ::

        $ pip install zentropi


    Current:
    ::

        $ git clone https://github.com/zentropi/python-zentropi.git
        $ cd python-zentropi
        $ pip install -e .
