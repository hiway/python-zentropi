# Tutorials: Get Started with Zentropi


1. **hello_agent**: We often introduce new programming tools with
    a small hello-world program, here is one made with zentropi.
    It starts up a built-in shell and responds when you type 'hello'
    and press enter at the prompt. Shows how you can interact with
    the agents you make.

2. **ping_pong**: Make two agents, one that broadcasts a 'ping' and
    another agent that responds to the ping with a 'pong' - shows
    how two agents can communicate between each other.

3. **spartans**: Make 300 Spartan agents, and use the zentropi shell to
    command them. We can run many agents in a single process - useful
    for easy deployment, energy efficiency and privacy.
